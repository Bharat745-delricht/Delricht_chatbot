Sponsored by Arthrosi Therapeutics, Inc., this trial will be conducted across approximately 100 sites in the United States and Canada. The primary objective is to assess the ability of AR882 to reduce serum uric acid (sUA) levels in participants, with a specific focus on achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL by Month 6.\n\nParticipants in the trial will be randomly assigned to receive either AR882 or a placebo. The study will be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the investigators will know which treatment each participant is receiving. The intervention involves the administration of AR882, with the primary aim of evaluating its efficacy in lowering sUA levels and reducing tophus burden. The CAPER method will be employed to assess the response of target tophi, with evaluations conducted at Months 6 and 12 to determine the presence of disease progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6. Secondary endpoints include the reduction of tophus burden and the maintenance of sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Months 9 and 12, alongside the absence of gout flares over a three-month period. The trial will last until all participants have completed 12 months or have discontinued. Notable inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of gout and baseline tophi, while exclusion criteria may involve other significant health conditions that could interfere with the study's outcomes.",

This means that neither you nor your doctor will know which treatment you are receiving, and participants will be randomly assigned to different treatment groups.  The study aims to determine how well ABP-745 works to treat acute gout flares compared to colchicine and a placebo.\n\nThis study is looking for men and women aged 18-70 with a BMI between 18 and 40 who have been diagnosed with gout and have experienced at least two gout flares in the past year.  You must be able to contact the study site and receive your first dose within 10 hours of a new flare starting, and you must be able to return to the site 24 hours after the first dose.  You will need to be able to attend several visits at the study site over a 7-day period during a flare and a final visit after treatment, as well as a safety follow-up phone call.

The main goals are to see how much ABP-745 reduces pain at 24 hours after the first dose compared to colchicine and placebo.  Other measurements will include pain levels at later time points, the percentage of people who experience significant pain reduction, and how the treatment affects markers of inflammation in your blood.

Sponsored by Arthrosi Therapeutics, Inc., this trial will be conducted across approximately 100 sites in the United States and Canada. The primary objective is to assess the ability of AR882 to reduce serum uric acid (sUA) levels in participants, with a specific focus on achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL by Month 6.\n\nParticipants in the trial will be randomly assigned to receive either AR882 or a placebo. The study will be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the investigators will know which treatment each participant is receiving. The intervention involves the administration of AR882, with the primary aim of evaluating its efficacy in lowering sUA levels and reducing tophus burden. The CAPER method will be employed to assess the response of target tophi, with evaluations conducted at Months 6 and 12 to determine the presence of disease progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6. Secondary endpoints include the reduction of tophus burden and the maintenance of sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Months 9 and 12, alongside the absence of gout flares over a three-month period. The trial will last until all participants have completed 12 months or have discontinued. Notable inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of gout and baseline tophi, while exclusion criteria may involve other significant health conditions that could interfere with the study's outcomes.",

This means that neither you nor your doctor will know which treatment you are receiving, and participants will be randomly assigned to different treatment groups.

You must be able to contact the study site and receive your first dose within 10 hours of a new flare starting, and you must be able to return to the site 24 hours after the first dose.  You will need to be able to attend several visits at the study site over a 7-day period during a flare and a final visit after treatment, as well as a safety follow-up phone call.

The main goals are to see how much ABP-745 reduces pain at 24 hours after the first dose compared to colchicine and placebo.  Other measurements will include pain levels at later time points, the percentage of people who experience significant pain reduction, and how the treatment affects markers of inflammation in your blood.

The study will be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the investigators will know which treatment each participant is receiving. The intervention involves the administration of AR882, with the primary aim of evaluating its efficacy in lowering sUA levels and reducing tophus burden. The CAPER method will be employed to assess the response of target tophi, with evaluations conducted at Months 6 and 12 to determine the presence of disease progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6. Secondary endpoints include the reduction of tophus burden and the maintenance of sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Months 9 and 12, alongside the absence of gout flares over a three-month period.

This helps ensure the results are unbiased.\n\nThis study is for adults with gout who have experienced at least two gout flares in the past year and have been taking a stable dose of allopurinol (300-600mg daily, or 200mg for those with moderate kidney problems) for at least 3 months.  You must also have a serum uric acid (sUA) level of 6.5 mg/dL or higher at two screening visits.  You will not be able to participate if you have certain other medical conditions (these will be discussed during screening).  During the study, you will be asked to keep a diary of your medication intake, any gout flares you experience, and any related healthcare visits.  \n\nIn this study, you will receive either dotinurad (the investigational drug) or allopurinol.  Dotinurad will be given in increasing doses over the first 12 weeks.  Allopurinol will be given at the same dose you were taking before the study began.  The study will measure how well each medication lowers sUA levels in your blood, reduces the number of gout flares you experience, and assess any side effects.  The main goal is to see if dotinurad is as effective as allopurinol in lowering sUA at 24 weeks.  Other goals include evaluating the impact on gout flares and overall safety.  You will have regular check-ups every 2 weeks initially, then every 4 weeks, and will be asked to complete questionnaires about your health.  Even if you stop taking the study medication, you will be encouraged to continue with the follow-up visits.",

The primary objective is to assess the ability of AR882 to reduce serum uric acid (sUA) levels in participants, with a specific focus on achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL by Month 6.\n\nParticipants in the trial will be randomly assigned to receive either AR882 or a placebo. The study will be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the investigators will know which treatment each participant is receiving. The intervention involves the administration of AR882, with the primary aim of evaluating its efficacy in lowering sUA levels and reducing tophus burden. The CAPER method will be employed to assess the response of target tophi, with evaluations conducted at Months 6 and 12 to determine the presence of disease progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6. Secondary endpoints include the reduction of tophus burden and the maintenance of sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Months 9 and 12, alongside the absence of gout flares over a three-month period. The trial will last until all participants have completed 12 months or have discontinued. Notable inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of gout and baseline tophi, while exclusion criteria may involve other significant health conditions that could interfere with the study's outcomes.",

Sponsored by Arthrosi Therapeutics, Inc., this trial will be conducted across approximately 100 sites in the United States and Canada. The primary objective is to assess the ability of AR882 to reduce serum uric acid (sUA) levels in participants, with a specific focus on achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL by Month 6.\n\nParticipants in the trial will be randomly assigned to receive either AR882 or a placebo. The study will be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the investigators will know which treatment each participant is receiving. The intervention involves the administration of AR882, with the primary aim of evaluating its efficacy in lowering sUA levels and reducing tophus burden. The CAPER method will be employed to assess the response of target tophi, with evaluations conducted at Months 6 and 12 to determine the presence of disease progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6. Secondary endpoints include the reduction of tophus burden and the maintenance of sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Months 9 and 12, alongside the absence of gout flares over a three-month period. The trial will last until all participants have completed 12 months or have discontinued. Notable inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of gout and baseline tophi, while exclusion criteria may involve other significant health conditions that could interfere with the study's outcomes.",

Sponsored by Arthrosi Therapeutics, Inc., this trial will be conducted across approximately 100 sites in the United States and Canada. The primary objective is to assess the ability of AR882 to reduce serum uric acid (sUA) levels in participants, with a specific focus on achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL by Month 6.\n\nParticipants in the trial will be randomly assigned to receive either AR882 or a placebo. The study will be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the investigators will know which treatment each participant is receiving. The intervention involves the administration of AR882, with the primary aim of evaluating its efficacy in lowering sUA levels and reducing tophus burden. The CAPER method will be employed to assess the response of target tophi, with evaluations conducted at Months 6 and 12 to determine the presence of disease progression.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Month 6. Secondary endpoints include the reduction of tophus burden and the maintenance of sUA levels below 6.0 mg/dL at Months 9 and 12, alongside the absence of gout flares over a three-month period. The trial will last until all participants have completed 12 months or have discontinued. Notable inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of gout and baseline tophi, while exclusion criteria may involve other significant health conditions that could interfere with the study's outcomes.",

The study will evaluate two different dosing regimens of VDPHL01: twice daily and once daily.  It will compare these regimens against a placebo to see if the medication promotes hair growth and improves patient satisfaction with their hair.\n\nWomen aged 18-65 with mild to moderate hair loss, as measured by the Savin Scale, are eligible to participate.  Key inclusion criteria include good general health, adequate kidney and liver function, and a commitment to maintaining consistent hair care routines throughout the study.  Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, have certain medical conditions (like uncontrolled blood pressure or a history of heart problems), or have recently used other hair growth treatments are excluded.\n\nThe study will last approximately 13 months and consist of two parts. Part A is a 6-month placebo-controlled period, where participants are randomly assigned to one of four groups: VDPHL01 twice daily, VDPHL01 once daily plus placebo, placebo twice daily, or placebo twice daily.  Part B is a 6-month treatment extension, where those initially receiving placebo will start taking VDPHL01 according to their initial group assignment, while those already on VDPHL01 will continue.  Participants will have regular clinic visits (approximately 11) for assessments including physical exams, blood and urine tests, electrocardiograms, photographs of the scalp, and questionnaires about their hair and quality of life. A small group of participants will also take part in interviews.  A final follow-up will occur one month after the treatment period ends.\n",

HS is a chronic skin condition that causes painful lumps, abscesses, and tunnels under the skin, often leaving scars.  Researchers believe brensocatib may help by reducing the activity of certain inflammatory cells involved in HS. The study aims to determine if brensocatib can reduce the number of skin lesions and improve overall skin condition in people with HS.\n\nTo be eligible for the study, participants must be between 18 and 80 years old with a confirmed HS diagnosis for at least six months. They must have at least six inflammatory lesions for at least eight weeks before joining the study and these lesions must be located in at least two different areas of the body, with at least one area having a certain level of severity (Hurley Stage II or III).  People with an excessively high number of draining tunnels or certain other skin conditions will be excluded, as will those who have recently received certain medications like systemic antibiotics (except for stable doses of doxycycline or minocycline), opioid painkillers (except tramadol), or biologic treatments for HS.\n\nThe CEDAR study is a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. This means participants are randomly assigned to receive either brensocatib (at a dose of 10mg or 40mg once daily) or a placebo pill. The study is divided into two treatment periods.  Period 1 lasts 16 weeks and compares brensocatib to placebo. Period 2 lasts 36 weeks, and all participants receive brensocatib (those initially on placebo will switch to either the 10mg or 40mg dose).  Throughout the study, participants will have regular visits to the clinic for assessments of their skin condition, pain levels, and overall quality of life. Blood samples will also be collected to monitor the drug's safety and measure its levels in the body.  Some participants will also be part of a sub-study involving skin tissue samples.  After the treatment periods, there is a 4-week follow-up period.",

The study's main goal is to determine if CIN-102 can reduce nausea severity compared to placebo.  Researchers will also assess changes in other gastroparesis symptoms like vomiting, fullness, early satiety, and abdominal pain.\n\nTo be eligible for the study, participants must be 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic gastroparesis, including both persistent symptoms and evidence of delayed gastric emptying.  Key exclusion criteria include having a known cause for their gastroparesis (like diabetes or surgery), certain heart conditions, specific gastrointestinal issues, or use of certain medications that could interfere with the study drug.  Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant are also excluded.\n\nThe study will last approximately 18 weeks, including a prescreening period, a screening and lead-in period of up to 5 weeks, a 12-week treatment period, and a follow-up period of up to 1 week.  Participants will attend up to 8 scheduled visits, including a gastric emptying breath test.  Throughout the study, they will track their symptoms daily using an electronic diary and will have regular assessments of their overall health and well-being.  Some participants may also choose to participate in additional assessments to help researchers understand how the drug is absorbed and processed by the body.",

Neither you nor your study doctor will know which treatment you are receiving, which helps ensure the results are unbiased. Your total participation in the study will last for approximately 18 weeks, which includes screening, a 6-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period.\n\nThis study is looking for adults between the ages of 18 and 74 who have been diagnosed with Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder and are currently experiencing a moderate to severe depressive episode. To be eligible, your current depressive episode must have lasted between 4 weeks and 12 months, and you must meet specific scores on depression rating scales. You may not be able to participate if you have recently had suicidal plans, have been found to be resistant to two or more previous treatments for your current episode, or are taking certain other psychiatric medications. The study team will review all eligibility criteria with you to determine if this study is a good fit.\n\nIf you join the study, you will take one capsule by mouth each day for 6 weeks; this will be either the investigational product or a placebo. The main purpose of the study is to see if the investigational product can reduce symptoms of depression more effectively than a placebo, which will be measured using a standard depression questionnaire (the MADRS). Researchers will also assess the product's effects on the loss of pleasure (anhedonia), its safety, and how quickly it may begin to work.

For the next 6 months, the study team will monitor your health and ask you to report any potential COVID-19 symptoms, which would then be confirmed with a PCR test. The study will also track other important health outcomes, such as hospitalizations or any side effects you may experience after the injection.",
