The study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which means you will be assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to receive either the investigational drug or a placebo (an inactive substance). Neither you nor your study doctor will know which treatment you are receiving, which helps ensure the results are unbiased. Your total participation will last approximately 16 weeks, which includes an initial screening and run-in period, a 12-week treatment period, and a final follow-up phone call two weeks after your last dose.\n\nThis study is seeking approximately 280 adults between the ages of 18 and 70 who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. To be eligible, you must currently be taking a stable regimen of two or more blood pressure medications, but still have a blood pressure reading of at least 130/80 mm Hg. There are several reasons you may not be able to participate, such as having very high blood pressure (over 170/110 mm Hg), a recent history of a heart attack or stroke, or current use of certain medications like nitrates or alpha-blockers. The study aims to enroll a diverse population, including patients with resistant hypertension who are on three or more medications.\n\nIf you qualify and choose to participate, you will first complete a 2-week period taking a placebo to ensure you can follow the study requirements. Afterwards, you will be randomly assigned to take a once-daily pill for 12 weeks, which will be one of three different doses of the investigational drug RTN-001 or a matching placebo. The main purpose of the study is to see if RTN-001 can effectively lower systolic blood pressure. Throughout the study, you will attend several clinic visits (at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) for procedures that include blood pressure measurements in the office, wearing a 24-hour blood pressure monitor at home, blood tests, heart tracings (ECGs), and physical exams.",

To be eligible, you must currently be taking a stable regimen of two or more blood pressure medications, but still have a blood pressure reading of at least 130/80 mm Hg. There are several reasons you may not be able to participate, such as having very high blood pressure (over 170/110 mm Hg), a recent history of a heart attack or stroke, or current use of certain medications like nitrates or alpha-blockers. The study aims to enroll a diverse population, including patients with resistant hypertension who are on three or more medications.\n\nIf you qualify and choose to participate, you will first complete a 2-week period taking a placebo to ensure you can follow the study requirements. Afterwards, you will be randomly assigned to take a once-daily pill for 12 weeks, which will be one of three different doses of the investigational drug RTN-001 or a matching placebo. The main purpose of the study is to see if RTN-001 can effectively lower systolic blood pressure. Throughout the study, you will attend several clinic visits (at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) for procedures that include blood pressure measurements in the office, wearing a 24-hour blood pressure monitor at home, blood tests, heart tracings (ECGs), and physical exams.",

The study will evaluate two different dosing regimens of VDPHL01: twice daily and once daily.  It will compare these regimens against a placebo to see if the medication promotes hair growth and improves patient satisfaction with their hair.\n\nWomen aged 18-65 with mild to moderate hair loss, as measured by the Savin Scale, are eligible to participate.  Key inclusion criteria include good general health, adequate kidney and liver function, and a commitment to maintaining consistent hair care routines throughout the study.  Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, have certain medical conditions (like uncontrolled blood pressure or a history of heart problems), or have recently used other hair growth treatments are excluded.\n\nThe study will last approximately 13 months and consist of two parts. Part A is a 6-month placebo-controlled period, where participants are randomly assigned to one of four groups: VDPHL01 twice daily, VDPHL01 once daily plus placebo, placebo twice daily, or placebo twice daily.  Part B is a 6-month treatment extension, where those initially receiving placebo will start taking VDPHL01 according to their initial group assignment, while those already on VDPHL01 will continue.  Participants will have regular clinic visits (approximately 11) for assessments including physical exams, blood and urine tests, electrocardiograms, photographs of the scalp, and questionnaires about their hair and quality of life. A small group of participants will also take part in interviews.  A final follow-up will occur one month after the treatment period ends.\n",

The study is designed to be multicenter, meaning it will take place at various clinics and hospitals. It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. This means participants will be randomly assigned (like a coin flip) to receive one of several different doses of zasocitinib or a placebo, which contains no active medicine. The double-blind design ensures that neither the participant nor the study doctor will know which treatment is being administered, which helps prevent bias in the results. The study will involve a screening period to determine eligibility, a treatment period, and a follow-up period.\n\nTo be eligible for this study, you must be an adult with a confirmed diagnosis of nonsegmental vitiligo. The study is looking for individuals whose vitiligo affects a certain amount of their body surface area and is considered stable or active. You may not be able to participate if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, have certain other medical conditions, or have recently used specific medications or therapies for vitiligo, including other JAK inhibitors or phototherapy. Before joining, the study team will explain all the details in an informed consent document, and you will have the opportunity to ask any questions to decide if participation is right for you.\n\nThe primary goal of this study is to evaluate how effective different doses of zasocitinib are at promoting skin repigmentation compared to a placebo. This will be measured by the study doctor using a standardized scoring system (Vitiligo Area Scoring Index, or VASI) that assesses changes in vitiligo on your face and body. The study will also assess the drug's safety and its impact on your quality of life through questionnaires. Participation requires regular visits to the study clinic for assessments, which will include physical exams, blood tests, medical photography to document skin changes, and completing surveys about your symptoms and well-being.",

To be eligible, your current depressive episode must have lasted between 4 weeks and 12 months, and you must meet specific scores on depression rating scales.

The main purpose of the study is to see if the investigational product can reduce symptoms of depression more effectively than a placebo, which will be measured using a standard depression questionnaire (the MADRS). Researchers will also assess the product's effects on the loss of pleasure (anhedonia), its safety, and how quickly it may begin to work.

The study will measure how well each medication lowers sUA levels in your blood, reduces the number of gout flares you experience, and assess any side effects.  The main goal is to see if dotinurad is as effective as allopurinol in lowering sUA at 24 weeks.  Other goals include evaluating the impact on gout flares and overall safety.  You will have regular check-ups every 2 weeks initially, then every 4 weeks, and will be asked to complete questionnaires about your health.

The study will measure how well each medication lowers sUA levels in your blood, reduces the number of gout flares you experience, and assess any side effects.  The main goal is to see if dotinurad is as effective as allopurinol in lowering sUA at 24 weeks.  Other goals include evaluating the impact on gout flares and overall safety.  You will have regular check-ups every 2 weeks initially, then every 4 weeks, and will be asked to complete questionnaires about your health.  Even if you stop taking the study medication, you will be encouraged to continue with the follow-up visits.",

This means that some participants will receive VK2735 while others receive a placebo, and neither the participants nor the study staff will know who is receiving which.  The study will take place over approximately 88 weeks, including a screening period, 78 weeks of treatment, and a follow-up period. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VK2735 for weight loss.  The locations of the study sites are not specified in this protocol excerpt.\n\nThis study is for adults who are obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m\u00b2) or overweight (BMI \u226527 kg/m\u00b2) with at least one weight-related health issue, but who do *not* have Type 2 Diabetes.  You must be willing to attend regular study visits and follow the study procedures.  Women make up no more than 65% of the participants to ensure enough men are included. The study aims to include people from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds and those over 65.  If you are eligible and choose to participate, you will be randomly assigned to receive either VK2735 or a placebo.  You will need to attend study visits regularly, especially in the first 33 weeks.\n\nParticipants will receive weekly injections of VK2735 or placebo under the skin. The dose of VK2735 will be gradually increased over several weeks until the target dose is reached.  The study will measure changes in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health indicators.  The main goal is to see if VK2735 is better than placebo at helping people lose weight.  Other goals include assessing the percentage of participants achieving various levels of weight loss (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%), and evaluating the impact of VK2735 on blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and quality of life.  Visits will be weekly for the first 33 weeks, then monthly, with self-administered injections between monthly visits.  You will also undergo regular blood tests, vital sign checks, and other assessments.",
